  "content": "<p>After several years of running my projects on AWS, I started to notice my monthly bills creeping up. While AWS provides excellent services, for my personal projects the costs were becoming difficult to justify. This led me to explore self-hosting alternatives.</p><h2>The AWS Setup</h2><p>My original setup included:</p><ul><li>Multiple EC2 instances for different applications</li><li>RDS for databases</li><li>S3 for static content and backups</li><li>CloudFront for content delivery</li><li>Route 53 for DNS management</li></ul><p>While this infrastructure worked well, the monthly costs were approaching $200, which felt excessive for personal projects.</p><h2>The Self-Hosted Alternative</h2><p>After researching options, I settled on:</p><ul><li>A mid-range dedicated server from Hetzner ($39/month)</li><li>Docker containers for application isolation</li><li>PostgreSQL and MongoDB running in containers</li><li>Nginx as a reverse proxy with Let's Encrypt SSL</li><li>Cloudflare for DNS and basic DDoS protection (free tier)</li><li>Backblaze B2 for backups ($5/month)</li></ul><p>This reduced my monthly infrastructure costs to approximately $45 total.</p>",
