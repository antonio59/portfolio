  "content": "<p>When I first started exploring home automation, I was drawn to the convenience of smart home products but concerned about privacy, reliability, and vendor lock-in. After trying several commercial solutions, I decided to build my own system that would run entirely on my local network.</p><h2>Why Self-Host Your Home Automation?</h2><p>Commercial smart home platforms like Google Home or Amazon Alexa are convenient, but they come with drawbacks:</p><ul><li>Privacy concerns - your data and usage patterns are stored on third-party servers</li><li>Internet dependency - if your connection goes down, your smart home may become unavailable</li><li>Limited customization - you are restricted to the features and integrations the vendor chooses to support</li><li>Subscription costs - many platforms are moving toward subscription models</li></ul><p>By self-hosting, you maintain complete control over your smart home system, data, and can customize it to your exact needs.</p>",
